# Viki

All the existing Obsidian setups I saw had some extra setup involved. I just want to take my existing Obsidian Vault and turn it into a wiki I can publish statically without any fuss.

Also it seemed fun.

## Random things that need doing

### General improvements

- Add external link icon only to external links via CSS class
- Tag pages
- TOC page
    - Tag badges

### Sidebar improvements

- Sort the sidebar so dirs/content aren't intermingled
- Keep sidebar open to current page
- Add expand all to sidebar
- Make sidebar not shift element position when expanding

## Random ideas for hard mode

Find the latest git commit for the note and add a 'Last updated' note somewhere on the rendered page.

Look at aferox package to use github as a backing store and serve/publish straight from github repos.
