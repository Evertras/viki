# Viki

All the existing Obsidian setups I saw had some extra setup involved. I just want to take my existing Obsidian Vault and turn it into a wiki I can publish statically without any fuss.

## Random ideas for hard mode

Find the latest git commit for the note and add a 'Last updated' note somewhere on the rendered page.

Look at aferox package to use github as a backing store and serve/publish straight from github repos.
